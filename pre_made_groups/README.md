# Pre-made Biome Groups

This folder contains pre-configured biome groups for Minecraft version 1.21.8. 
These groups are provided as a starting point for common biome categories.

## ⚠️ Important Version Notice

The biome lists in these groups were created during the **1.21.8 era** of Minecraft. 
Future Minecraft versions may introduce new biomes that won't be included in these groups.

### What this means:
- Biomes added after 1.21.8 won't be in these groups
- Some biome names might change in future versions
- You may need to update these groups for newer Minecraft versions

## How to Use
1. Copy the JSON files you want to use into the `groups` folder
2. Run the Biome Tool and select "Process by group" to use them

## Groups Included
- `overworld.json` - Main overworld biomes
- `nether.json` - Nether biomes
- `end.json` - End biomes
- `all_biomes.json` - All biomes available in 1.21.8

## Customizing Groups
Feel free to edit these files:
- Add new biome names to include them
- Remove biome names to exclude them
- Create new group files for custom collections

## Updating for New Versions
When Minecraft updates:
1. Download the new biomes using the tool (Option 3)
2. Compare new biome names with these groups
3. Add any new biomes to the appropriate groups
4. Remove any renamed or removed biomes
